# FiveM React + TypeScript Boilerplate.

- Functional boilerplate for NUI development.

**Guide on how to start using the boilerplate:**

1.  Navigate to the "ui" folder and enter in:

        npm install

2.  Once all of the necessary packages are installed, you can run: [ To start a development server ]

        npm run start

3.  Or you can run: [ To deploy a prod build for your server ]

        npm run build
